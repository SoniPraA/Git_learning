Docker Volume and how to share it.

Volume is simply a directory inside our container
Firstly, we have to declare the directory as a volume and then share volume
Evenif we stop container, still we can access volume
Volume will be created in one container
You can declare a directory as a volume, only while creating container
You con't create volume from existing container
You can share one volume across any number of containers
Volume will not be included when you update an image
You can mapped volume in two ways:-
1. Container <=> Container
2. Host <=> Container

Benefits of Volume
Decoupling Container from storage
Share Volume among different containers
Attach Volume to containers
On deleting container volume does not delete

Creating Volume From Dcokerfile
1. Create a Dockerfile and write
FROM ubuntu
VOLUME ["/muvolume1"]

Then create an image from this Dockerfile
Docker build -t myimage .

Now create a container from this image & run
docker run -it --name container1 myimage /bin/bash

Now do ls. you can see myvolume1

Now, share Volume with another container
Container1 <==> Container2

docker run -it --name container2 --privileged=true --volumes-from container1 ubuntu /bin/bash

Now after creating container2, myvolume1 is visible whatever you do 
in one volume, can see from other volumes

touch /myvolume1/samplefile
docker start container1
docker attach container1
ls/myvolume1
you can see samplefile here
