What is Docker

The container is like a Virtual Machine
Docker is a tool that creates VM
Docker Engine

Docker is an open source Centralised platform designed to Create, Deploy and Run Applications.
Docket uses a container on the host OS to run applications. It allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual OS.
We can install Docker on any OS but the Docker engine runs on Linux distribution.
Docker is written in the "Go" language.
Docker is a tool that performs OS-level virtualization, also known as containerization.
Before Docker, many users face the problem that a particular code runs the developer system but in the user's system.
Docker was first released in March 2013. Solman Hykes and Sebastian Pahl develop it.
Docker is a set of platforms as a service that uses OS-level virtualization where as VMware uses Hardware level virtualization.
