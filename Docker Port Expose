Docker Port Expose

Difference between docker attach and docker exec

Docker exec creates a new process in the container's environment while docker attach
just connect the standard input/output of the main process inside the container to 
corresponding standard input/output error of the current terminal.

Docker exec is specifically for running new things in a already started containers, 
be it a shell or other process.

Pid => Process ID
PPID => Parent Process ID

What is the difference between expose and publish (-p) a docker

Basically you have three options :-
1. Neither specify expose not -p
2. Only specify expose
3. Specify expose and -p

1. If you specify neither expose nor -p, the service in the container will only be 
accessible from inside the container itself.

2. If you expose a port, the service in the conatiner is not accessible from outside
docker, but form inside other docker containers, so this is good for inter-container communication.
 
3. If you expose and -p a port, ther service in the ocntainer is accessible from anywhere, even
outside docker.

If you do -p but do not ecpose docker does an implicit expose. this is because, if a port is open to the public, it is 
automatically also open to the other docker containers. Hence "-p" incluudes expose.

docker run -td --name <container_name> -p 80:80 ubuntu
(-d = daemon 80:80 = Port or publish : container)
